# PIC16F877A_multi_authentication_door_lock

This project is meant to build and compile a program to be run on a microprocessor, namely, PIC16F877A. 
The system shall act as a prototype for a multi-factor authentication door lock system.
The first authentication mechanism is an RFID card, and the second is a finger print.
